        first, go to the terminal, either by clicking on tools, then terminal. you can also use the keystroke <code>shift+alt+t</code>
    </p>
    <p>

        now, we need to tell git what files we want to commit. first, we need to know what files have changed since the last commit. <code>git status</code> will show you that.
    </p>
    <p>

        now we need to add the files we want to commit to the "HEAD". the head is a place where we store the names of the files we want to update.
    </p>
    <p>

        to add a file to the head, use <code>git add [file name]</code> to add it to the head.
    </p>
    <p>

        now, we need to actually commit the changes. simply run <code>git commit</code> to do that.</p>
    <p>

        when you are sure the master is stable, go back to the terminal and run <code>git push</code> . that will send your chances to github.com.</p>
